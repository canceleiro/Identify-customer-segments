# Identify Customer Segments
### by Javier Alonso


## Installations required

The project contains a jupyter notebook, so that´s the only necessary software you´d need. Be sure to have installed on it numpy, pandas,  matplotlib and seaborn

## Project motivation

In this project we will try to identify segments in population that have more chance to be a client to our company, so we will focus our next communication campaign on these people.

We have have two databases: characteristics of general population and of our customers. We will cluster the general population, and see to which clusters our customers fit.
